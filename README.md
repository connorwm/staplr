staplr is a feed aggregation service written in Java using MongoDB, JodaTime, JSON Simple, and my personal library FFW which eases networking and date handling. It is designed to run 24/7 on a server to parse feeds and store entries as they are published. A frontend service is then used to display and manipulate those stored feeds to the user's desire.
This project is not provided with any support or warranty. Minor changes would need to be made in order to run it on your own system (namely the FFW library). However the minor changes can be made by implementing your own classes and methods.
